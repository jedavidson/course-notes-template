A template for structured $\LaTeX$ lecture notes.

This is the same format used for my [Galois theory lecture notes](https://github.com/jedavidson/galois-theory), but made more generic for reuse in other note projects.

This setup works on Overleaf and on my local `pdflatex` setup, so your mileage may potentially vary if you use a different compiler.
